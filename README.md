You can change the replayed location/orientation script (in .LOSCript-files) using "Dataset"-spinbox. There's also "visibility scripts" that can be activated with the checkbox. These scripts were used to generate videos so that the visibilities of different objects could be scripted and also timeshift of timeshifted object can be manipulated. Otherwise I'd recommend to just try everything out if interested. There's nothing to broke (I hope).
